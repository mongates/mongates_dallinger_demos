        <h4>Speaker Test</h4>
        <p>
            The following test will check to see if your speakers are working.
            <br>
            Please press the play button. If you can clearly hear a beep, you
            <br>
            are ready to begin the experiment.

        <h4>In this experiment, you will see a list of words presented one at
              a time. Try to remember as many as possible: you will be tested on these words later.</h4>
              <br>
              <p> You will now either be directed to a waiting room,
            or the words could begin appearing immediately!</p>

                (meaning you have seen the words and done the task), we request that
